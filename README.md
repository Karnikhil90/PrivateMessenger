# THE JOURNEY TO BE BETTER - A PRIVATE MESSENGER AND SPA BASED APP

================================================================

## Overview

This project is a full-stack development endeavor, aiming to create a private messenger and single-page application (SPA) with a Python Responder-based server and a NoSQL database. The initial focus is on login functionality, with ambitious plans to evolve into an all-encompassing app inspired by Elon Musk's concept of an 'everything app' (X).
